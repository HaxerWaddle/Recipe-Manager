RECIPE MANAGER
## Description
This is a personal and learning project made by me with the help of freeCodeCamp's Flask introduction. You can find it here: https://youtu.be/Z1RJmh_OqeA?si=I2Tuh06Pm2Ke2CEq

## Features
- 1.Add Recipes: Users can add new recipes with a title, ingredients, and instructions.
-  2.View Recipes: Display a list of saved recipes with their details.
-  3.Edit Recipes: Users can update existing recipes.
-  4.Delete Recipes: Users can delete recipes they no longer want.

2. Install the required dependencies:

    `pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy`
(Note: You may need to create a virtual environment first if you prefer to use one.)
